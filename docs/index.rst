Psifr documentation
===================

In free recall, participants study a list of items and then name all of the
items they can remember in any order they choose. Many sophisticated analyses
have been developed to analyze data from free recall experiments, but these
analyses are often complicated and difficult to implement.

Psifr leverages the Pandas data analysis package to make precise and flexible
analysis of free recall data faster and easier.

See the code repository for version `release notes`_.
